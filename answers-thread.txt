Q: Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.
A: When concurrency happens, we need handle race conditions.
A simple example is two thread simultaneously insert, (k0, v0), (k1, v1).
code: *p = e; will override the other, so one element will be lost.
